## Problem 1 What is a Net Cat (100 Points)

The goal of this project is to understand how the nc (NetCat) Command works.  You are given an ip and a port and use those with the nc command to get the key.

### Steps taken
1. Look up the address given in the problem.  It gave a download for the code of a webpage.  The code had nothing of note.

2. Look up what NetCat was.  It is a way to access ip addresses from through specific ports if you know what they are.

3. Try the command.  It worked.  I got a key and gained 100 points!


## Problem 7 PW Crack 3 (100 Points)

The goal is to find the password to unencrypt a file through the use of some snooping around.

### Steps Taken
1. The first step was to download all the files.  Right-click, copy link address.  Done.

2. Then I opened the python program, since the problem mentioned that the passwords would be placed somewhere in there.

3. There was a cheeky message saying that the password would not be found in the program, but I scrolled down anyways and found some passwords to try.

4. I copied the passwords down and tried them one at a time until the fourth password worked.  I got the key and 100 points!



## Problem 3 Wave a Flag (10 Points)

The goal of this project is to learn to invoke help tools using the command -h

### Steps taken
1. I looked through the hints to see if there was a way to get some help, and hint 2 gave me a download link to get the file on the webshell.

2. After signing into the webshell, I used wget to get the file on my webshell and then ran the file using a ./

3. It then said to use a -h to invoke some help.  This gave me the key and I scored another 10 points!


## Problem 14 Easy1 (100 Points)

You are given a key and the encrypted flag and have to decrypt the flag.

### Steps Taken
1. Already I know that the first thing to do is read the table that we were given which shows how the cryptography pad works.

2. I downloaded the table and look through it to see what is on it, and I have a pretty good idea of what is expected to be done.

3. The next step is to start comparing the key to the garbled mess of letters that we are given, except I decide instead to go to the first website I find when I google, decrypt one time pad, go to this url: https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/one-time-pad, enter the key and the encoded phrase and get the key.  Easy 100 points.


## Problem 17 Packets Primer (100 Points)

The goal is to look at a group of packets that are given to you and find the key inside of those packets.

### Steps Taken
1. It said that downloading wireshark is a good way to examine packets in the hint so I downloaded wireshark.

2. I opened the download with wireshark and started to snoop around.  I had very little ideas of what I was looking for.  There were some phrases that I could see that were kinda telling me to look at specific packets.

3. After looking around the packets I found the flag hidden in a set of bytes translated for me to look at and found a key.  100 points acquired.
